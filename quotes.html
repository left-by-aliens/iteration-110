                        “Fine then. I spit on the honor of the Sandvipers, that pathetic collection of cowards and cripples. You don't have a spine between you, you only use poison because it takes courage to face an enemy in battle, and I could improve on a Sandviper warrior by stapling a snake to a scarecrow's arm.

                        "I'd say he looks like an evil sect leader's rebellious son.” He thought a moment longer and added, “Wearing his mother's robe.” — <strong>Eithan</strong><br><br>

                        Yushi was a Herald on a lightning Path, and one of Reigan Shen’s closest companions. She was colloquially known as the Thunder Fairy, a name she hated. There were children’s rhymes about her. Eithan had written one himself.<br><br>
                        “Pride. One moment.” The short Akura Underlord bristled, then took a step closer to Lindon. “You seem to have forgotten that I’m the one who—” Lindon seized him, terror filling his words. “Every second we waste is another point gone. You understand? We’re losing points.” <br><br>
                        “Apologies, but why are you stealing from us?” “I need points!” “Understandable.”<br><br>
                        Lindon bent his every second to earning points.<br><br>
                        “Your masks or your lives,” Lindon said.<br><br>
                        A gold-rimmed glass lens sat over one of Eithan’s eyes, and a crown of shining crystals hovered over his head. As he came to a stop, shimmering white wings of light spread from behind him. It was the ugliest, most unnecessary thing Yerin had ever seen.<br><br>
                        “You look like you sleep under someone else’s bed. Do mirrors break when you walk by? I figured why your Shadow left: it couldn’t stand looking at its own face every day.”<br><br>
                        “Blood Yerin,” the Winter Sage put in. “You could call her ‘Blerin.’”<br><br>
                        Xorrus choked out a voice tinged with fear and anger, “Why? If you could advance, why did you wait?” A Forged hand of shadow grabbed her by the scaled throat, and Fury pulled her close. He was only the size of one of her eyes. “To see this look on your face.”<br><br>
                        The moment stretched between them as Crusher looked down on them. Dross and Lindon prepared to feed. The Blood Shadow turned and ran.<br><br>

                        If anyone else was having as good a time, it was Little Blue. She had grown addicted to training Kelsa, and was now seeking out fights with the other Jades and Golds on the ship.<br><br>

                        Little Blue hopped off his shell and stood beside him, arms crossed. The sound she made was among the harshest he’d ever heard from her; it sounded like someone had slapped a cat.<br><br>
                        Then Eithan turned to face Lindon entirely. “Everyone misunderstands me. Reigan Shen isn’t the one I’m trying to surpass.” He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. “He is.”<br>Ozmanthus Arelius waved.<br><br>
                        I practice the sacred arts so that I won’t be worthless anymore.<br>“I am not content with this world,” Lindon said.<br>I advance.<br>“I want more. I want…everything.”<br>And now he felt the third advancement in him. He almost said the words:<br>I will never stop.<br>But the Archlord revelation was all about his future, and this one wasn’t to his liking. So he changed it.<br>“We,” Lindon said, “will never stop.”<br><br>
                        "It’s very important that we adhere to the rules of fair play!” Eithan called, blocking another escape attempt by the handful of Golds.<br><br>
                        “Remove restraints and release authority. Authorization zero-zero-eight…Ozriel.”<br><br>
                        “We have stared into the abyss and lived to tell the tale,” Ziel said. “I’m going to sleep.”<br><br>
                        Reigan Shen looked at the hunger binding in his hand. By any means necessary, he had to get those Lords out of Cradle.<br>Or he was dead.<br><br>

                        “It’s hard to be correct all the time,” Ozmanthus said. “Almost as hard as it is to be so handsome. You may praise me again.”<br><br>
                        "So Daruman told you I was weak, did he?”<br>Gerravon closed his eyes and remembered his life.<br>“Weaker,” the Reaper said. “He should have said weaker.”<br><br>
                        His oath was like a living thing, a spirit wrapped around his throat.<br>[Oh sorry, that was me,] Dross said, taking his tentacle from around Lindon’s neck.<br><br>
                        She didn’t speak, but her owl spoke for her. “I’d rather not fight…but I am my father’s daughter.”<br><br>
                        [There are twelve more Underlord Countermeasures,] Dross said, startling her. [You wondered, didn’t you? Sixteen in total. Meet Bludgeon, The Immolator, and Creeping Death. I named them.]<br><br>
                        This Dreadgod had always reminded her of Reigan Shen for more reasons than just the obvious; maybe white cats were all this arrogant. She should outlaw white cats in her territory.<br><br>
                        “We do belong together.” The Void Icon bled into his voice. “When I Consume your spirit and tear out your heart, you will be with me forever.”<br><br>
                        [Honored Monarch, Queen of the…trees…I come with a request. Gratitude. I should have said “Gratitude” in there somewhere. Maybe “apologies” too.]<br><br>
                        “At last!” the spirit of the black dragon prince cried. “I am fr—”<br>Its perception stretched upward and froze. Then the spiritual sense spun right back into its soul.<br>“Put me back!” Noroloth demanded.<br><br>
                        “I have not yet begun to take from you"<br><br>
                        “Tell them how strong you are.”<br>Dross’ eye glittered. A shining halo appeared over his head, and then the world began to flex as he distorted the senses of everyone in the room. A thousand copies of Dross appeared in every square inch of air.<br>[Strong,] they all said.<br><br>
                        “These are attack points that a sympathetic Monarch helped Dross identify.”<br>[A Monarch who shall remain nameless,] Dross said before he coughed out a mouthful of leaves.<br><br>
                        Lindon listened with interest to the story of the Ninecloud continent’s ruling family even as he robbed them.<br><br>
                        “Oh no, we’re under attack,” Larian muttered. With one finger, she plucked the string of the bow lying next to her. “Eat my best techniques, robbers! Pchew, pchew!” She clapped a hand to her armored chest. “Ack! They got me! I’ll tell my grandchildren of this battle. Let us part with mutual respect.”<br><br>
                        “You fought a mighty battle, did you?” Reigan Shen asked.<br>Larian nodded seriously. “Top ten of my life. Maybe top three.”<br><br>
                        “Oh, they’re already fighting Malice!” Ozriel said brightly. “Yes! Get her! Stab her once for me!”<br><br>
                        “To recognize the extraordinary threat he represents, he is to be considered a fourth Dreadgod. As he is but a child spitting in the face of his betters, let him be known as the Whiny Child."<br><br>
